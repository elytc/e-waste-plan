# E-Waste Collection and Recycling Business Plan

## Ely Tech Collaborative - Youth E-Waste Initiative

> **What is this?** This is a working business plan for a youth-led e-waste
> collection and recycling program in the Ely, Minnesota area.
> Everyone on the team should contribute to filling in the sections below.
> If you don't know an answer yet, that's okay - write down your best guess
> and mark it with ❓ so we can research it together.

## 1. The Problem We're Solving

Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest-growing type of waste in the world.
Old computers, phones, TVs, printers, and other electronics contain
both valuable materials (copper, gold, aluminum) and hazardous ones
(lead, mercury, cadmium) that shouldn't end up in landfills.

**The rural challenge:** In a remote area like Ely, people often have
nowhere convenient to drop off old electronics. The nearest recycling
centers may be hours away. That means devices pile up in garages,
basements, and sheds - or worse, end up in the trash.

### Background

> Minnesota generates roughly 266 million pounds of e-waste per year,
> but only about 20-25% gets properly recycled.
> Source: [RECA](https://reca-us.org/)

> Right now, we are dumping or exporting the majority of valuable metals from our electronic waste.
> If we recycle all of our e-waste in the State of Minnesota, we could create over 1,700 jobs.

### Our Opportunity

_Fill in: What specific need have we identified in our community?_

- [ ] How many households are in our service area?
- [ ] Where do people currently take their old electronics?
- [ ] How far do they have to drive?
- [ ] What types of devices do people most want to get rid of?

---

## 2. Our Mission

_Fill in: Write 1-2 sentences about what we want to accomplish._

**Draft:** We collect and responsibly recycle electronic waste from the
Ely area, making it easy for our neighbors to do the right thing
with their old devices while keeping hazardous materials out of
our lakes and forests.

## 3. What We Collect

Minnesota law requires recycling of video display devices and other
covered electronic devices (CEDs). Here's what we plan to accept:

| Category         | Examples                          | Accept? | Notes                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Computers        | Desktops, laptops, tablets        | ☐       |                                        |
| Phones           | Cell phones, landlines            | ☐       |                                        |
| Displays         | Monitors, TVs                     | ☐       | Heavy! Old CRTs can weigh 50+ lbs      |
| Printers         | Printers, scanners, copiers       | ☐       |                                        |
| Peripherals      | Keyboards, mice, cables, chargers | ☐       |                                        |
| Small appliances | Routers, modems, game consoles    | ☐       |                                        |
| Batteries        | Lithium-ion, rechargeable         | ☐       | ⚠️ Fire hazard - need special handling |
| Other            | _list here_                       | ☐       |                                        |

### 3.1 What We Do NOT Accept (at least to start)

- Large appliances (refrigerators, washers) - too heavy, need special equipment
- Anything with Freon or refrigerant - requires certified handling
- Items we aren't sure about - when in doubt, ask our recycling partner

### 3.2 Research Tasks

- [ ] Contact MPCA for the full list of covered electronic devices
- [ ] Find out what our downstream recycling partner will and won't take
- [ ] Learn about battery safety and storage requirements

## 4. How It Works - Our Process

```text
Community          Collection         Sorting &          Transport to        Recycling
Members            Events &           Staging            Recycler            Partner
                   Drop-off
  📱💻🖥️    →     📦               →    🏠             →     🚛            →    ♻️
  Old devices       We collect          We sort,            We load up          Certified
  pile up at        at scheduled        test, and           and deliver         recycler
  home              times/places        organize            to partner          processes
```

### 4.1 Step-by-Step

1. **Community Outreach** - Let people know when and where to bring devices
2. **Collection** - Accept devices at events or our drop-off location
3. **Intake & Logging** - Record what we receive (type, condition, donor)
4. **Sorting** - Separate by type and condition
5. **Data Wiping** - Erase any personal data from storage devices
6. **Testing** - Check if anything is still usable (potential resale/reuse)
7. **Staging** - Organize and palletize for transport
8. **Transport** - Deliver to our certified recycling partner
9. **Documentation** - Track what was recycled for reporting

### 4.2 Research Tasks

- [ ] Where will our staging/sorting area be?
- [ ] What tools and supplies do we need? (screwdrivers, bins, pallets, labels)
- [ ] What software or spreadsheet will we use to track inventory?
- [ ] How will we wipe data? (Research NIST 800-88 guidelines or DBAN software)

## 5. The Big Challenge - Transportation 🚛

> **This is probably our hardest problem.** Ely is remote.
> Certified e-waste recyclers are likely in the Twin Cities metro area
> or Duluth. That's a long drive with heavy cargo.

### 5.1 Transportation Options to Research

| Option                           | Pros                                               | Cons                                                       | Estimated Cost |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Rent a truck/trailer**         | Flexible scheduling, we control timing             | Fuel cost, needs driver with right license, wear and tear  | ❓             |
| **Partner with existing hauler** | They already make the trip, professional           | Less control over schedule, may charge per load            | ❓             |
| **Coordinate with county**       | County may have existing collection infrastructure | Bureaucracy, may not match our timeline                    | ❓             |
| **Consolidation model**          | Batch up enough to make each trip worthwhile       | Need secure storage space while we accumulate              | ❓             |
| **Piggyback on other trips**     | Cheap! If someone is driving to Duluth/Twin Cities | Unreliable, can't count on it                              | ❓             |
| **Recycler picks up**            | No transport cost to us!                           | Recycler may require minimum volume, may charge pickup fee | ❓             |

### Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] How far is it to our nearest certified recycler? (Miles and drive time)
- [ ] What volume (weight or pallet count) do we need to make a trip worth it?
- [ ] Can we partner with St. Louis County for transport?
- [ ] Does our recycling partner offer pickup if we hit a minimum weight?
- [ ] Could we coordinate with other communities along the route to share a load?
- [ ] What does truck rental actually cost? (U-Haul, Home Depot, local options)
- [ ] Are there grants that specifically cover transportation costs?
- [ ] Is there a volunteer with a truck and trailer who could help?

### Our Transportation Plan

_Fill in after researching the options above._

**Frequency:** How often will we make a run? (Monthly? Quarterly? When we fill a trailer?)

**Route:** Ely → **\_** → Recycling Partner Location

**Cost per trip:** $**\_** (fuel + rental + tolls + food)

**Break-even volume:** We need at least **\_** lbs per trip to cover costs

## 8. Legal and Safety Stuff

This isn't the most exciting part, but it's important.

### Minnesota Regulations

- **Minnesota Electronics Recycling Act** - Governs how e-waste must be handled
- **MPCA Registration** - Collectors that operate ongoing programs must register
  by July 15 each year
- **Certified Recyclers** - We must send our collected items to an MPCA-registered
  recycler (look for R2 or e-Stewards certification)
- **Hazardous Materials** - Lead, mercury, and cadmium in electronics are regulated;
  we need to handle them properly

### Safety Rules for Our Team

- [ ] Always wear gloves when handling old electronics
- [ ] Never open CRT monitors or TVs (they can hold dangerous electrical charge)
- [ ] Store lithium batteries separately in a fireproof container
- [ ] Wash hands after handling electronics
- [ ] Lift with your legs - old TVs and printers are heavy!
- [ ] No food or drinks in the sorting area

### Research Tasks

- [ ] Do we need to register as a collector with MPCA?
- [ ] Does our nonprofit status affect any requirements?
- [ ] What insurance do we need?
- [ ] Talk to a local recycler about their requirements for accepting our materials

---

## 9. Marketing and Community Outreach

People need to know we exist and trust that we'll handle their old devices responsibly.

### How We'll Spread the Word

- [ ] Flyers at the grocery store, library, post office, community center
- [ ] Announce at city council / township meetings
- [ ] Local newspaper or community newsletter
- [ ] Social media (Facebook community groups especially)
- [ ] Partner with local businesses (they have e-waste too!)
- [ ] School announcements
- [ ] Word of mouth - in a small community, this is powerful

### Collection Event Ideas

- **Spring Cleaning E-Waste Day** - Annual community event
- **Monthly drop-off hours** - Regular, predictable schedule
- **Business pickup service** - Offer to pick up from local businesses
- **Partnership events** - Combine with other community cleanup events

### Our Message

_Fill in: What's our 30-second pitch?_

> "Got old electronics collecting dust? Bring them to [EVENT] on [DATE].
> We'll make sure they're recycled responsibly - no more worrying about
> what to do with that old TV in the basement. Free for most items.
